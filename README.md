## Information
A simple but useful Hypixel Skyblock mod for forge 1.8.9 that checks NBT data, public api, private api, and item history for duped items. If duped items appear, it will darken the background of the item. 

## Pros
Lots of people have gotten wiped, but with this mod, you can prevent that. You can check if any item you have is duped or not. This uses Hypixel's API to see if it has matching item data with any other item(s). Also, our use of Hypixel's API is more advanced than **Skytils/SBE**. This means that it has higher dupe-detecting quality, and can detect some items that **Skytils/SBE** can't.

## Hypixel Rules
This mod follows Hypixel's rules in our interpretation. Similar to most Skyblock mods, it is in the 'gray area'. This means **use at your own risk**.

## Config
**O** - Opens Dupe Checker's config. <br />
**[** - Quick toggle dupe checker. <br />
You can change these settings in the controls menu.
